If it relates to what you're researching, by all means elaborate and give us your insight, otherwise it could just be an interesting paper you've read.

Please try to provide some insight from your understanding and please don't post things which are present in wiki.

Preferably you should link the arxiv page (not the PDF, you can easily access the PDF from the summary page but not the other way around) or any other pertinent links.

I volunteer for a Seattle based nonprofit that puts on speaking events.

One of our speakers did a 5 minute talk about a cat door he created using machine learning.

His cat was bringing in dead animals to the house, so he created a cat door that will automatically lock for 15 minutes when the cat has something in its mouth. To do this he connected a camera to the cat door and used machine learning to check the image of the cat and whether the door should be locked or not.

It helps you organize experiment results, checkpoints and summaries, and takes care of console outputs.
